# rock-paper-scissors
This project is a prgramming example of the real classic game. It is playable in 5 rounds, where the user is required to write the input each time (rock, paper or scissors), whereas the computer's input is randomly generated. If the user inputs an invalid answer, the game shows a message and starts over. At the end, a winner is declared and the final result is shown. 

The game is written in JavaScript within a script tag in an HTML document, and it only runs in console with no user interface. It will be modified in the future to be more interactive and visualized.
